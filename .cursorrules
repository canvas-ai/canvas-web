# Project Overview

We are building a web frontend for "Canvas", a cross-platform desktop overlay to help organize work / workflows and data into separate "contexts".
Contexts are represented by a tree structure resembling a file-system hierarchy; every tree node("directory") represents a separate layer filtering down all unstructured information fighting for a users attention(emails, notifications, browser tabs, chat messages etc) using bitmaps
Context URL structure: sessionID@workspaceID://context/url, for example my-laptop@universe://work/acme/devops/jira-1234

This repository is only the web frontend with no backend code.
All interaction with the backend is done via REST API endpoints.

We will use the default black-and-white shadcn/ui theme

Main page should be based on the Authentication example: https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/authentication

After login, user should be redirected to /canvas
Dashboard should contain a icon for each workspace the user has access to, clicking on a workspace icon should open a sidebar with the workspace global context tree

Tree element should allow dragging and dropping to reorder the tree

Tree element should have a context menu with the following options:
- Rename
- Remove (remove the element from the tree)
- Delete (remove the element from the tree and from the database)
- Create (add a new element to the tree)
