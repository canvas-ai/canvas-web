# Project Overview

We are building a web frontend for "Canvas", a cross-platform desktop overlay to help organize work / workflows and data into separate "contexts".
Contexts are represented by a tree structure resembling a file-system hierarchy; every tree node("directory") represents a separate layer filtering down all unstructured information fighting for a users attention(emails, notifications, browser tabs, chat messages etc) using bitmaps
Context URL structure: contextID@workspaceID://context-url, for example work-nb@universe://work/acme/devops/jira-1234

This repository is only the web frontend with no backend code.
All interaction with the backend is done via REST API endpoints and websocket connections.

We will use the default black-and-white shadcn/ui theme

Main page should be based on the Authentication example: https://ui.shadcn.com/examples/authentication

Dashboard should contain an icon for each workspace the user has access to,
clicking on a workspace icon should open a sidebar with the workspace global context tree

Tree element should allow dragging and dropping to reorder the tree
